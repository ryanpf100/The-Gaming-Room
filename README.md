# The-Gaming-Room
CS-230-H7226 Mod 8 assignment
The gaming room wanted their game Draw It or Lose It to be transfered over to multiple operating systems
for cross-play matches. 

I think that covering the cloud based servers for linux was something that I did particularly well and I did a bit of research on the subject.

I think that always going back to what the user needs in design will ground you a bit more and keep away potential scope creep. This way you stay on task and don't make more changes before finishing others.

I think that I would be a bit more structured in the order that I create my software in the future. I was kind of all over the place for this assignment and had trouble keeping track of what code did what in which object. I think better organization would have helped me out.
